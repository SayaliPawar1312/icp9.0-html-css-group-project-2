After this, a bigger crowd followed her during a roadshow. On her way to Balali from Delhi, Vinesh was felicitated by her supporters and 'khap' panchayats in several villages, with the 135km-long journey taking her almost 13 hours on Saturday.<br><br>In her native village Balali, Vinesh was even felicitated with a gold medal by community elders, as per a post by Sportstar on X.<br><br>Vinesh Phogat was presented a gold medal by community elders in her native village. A massive crowd is in attendance despite the felicitation beginning well past midnight.<br><br>Overwhelmed by the grand reception she received on her arrival from the Paris Olympics, Vinesh said it would be a matter of great pride for her if she could train women wrestlers from her village Balali and they become more successful than her.<br><br>Vinesh's appeal against her disqualification was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).<br><br>Vinesh, 29, reached her native village around midnight and was accorded a grand welcome. Her neighbours and friends met her with tears and smiles and patted her for the courage she has shown.<br><br>Exhausted after a tiring journey that began in Paris, Vinesh addressed the gathering before calling it a day. The two-time World Championships medallist wished that someone from Balali would better her wrestling achievements. <br><br>"It would be disappointing if no wrestler emerged from this village. We have paved the way, given hope with our achievements. I request you all to support the women in this village. They need your support, hope and trust if they have to replace us in future," Vinesh said.</p>
